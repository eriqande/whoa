#' Restriction-associated digest (RAD) sequence data from 36 lobsters at 2000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
#'
#' A data set from the study by Benestan et al. (2016).
#'
#' @format A `vcfR' object in which the original data set has
#' been reduced to just the 36 lobsters from the BUZ population
#' and a randomly sampled 2000 SNPs from the 10,156 originally
#' available.
#'
#' This is the sort of object obtained after calling \code{vcfR::read.vcfR()}
#' on a variant call format (VCF) file.
