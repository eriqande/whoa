## Red Drum

Let us first try the red drum data set.  This is in the gbs-miscall-rate repo.

```{r}
# paths here not reproducible
# read the vcf
v <- read.vcfR("../../gbs-miscall-rates/raw_data/red_drum_Final_Filtered_SNPs.vcf.gz")

# these are all considered to be a separate population, so we can just run
# infer_m() on the whole schmeer

# let's shoot for at least 50K genotypes in each bin
m <- infer_m(v, minBin = 50000)


# now, let's make a picture
g <- posteriors_plot(m$m_posteriors)

# print it
g

```


OK, that is all working.
