Description: This is a small, lightweight package that lets users investigate the distribution of genotypes in genotype-by-sequencing (GBS) data where they expect (by and large) Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, in order to assess rates of genotyping errors and the dependence of those rates on read depth.  It implements an MCMC sampler  using Rcpp to compute Bayesian estimate of what we call the heterozygote miscall rate for RAD-seq data and other types of reduced representation GBS data. It also provides functions to generate plots of expected and observed genotype frequencies. Some background on these topics can be found in a recent paper (Hendricks et al., 2018, Recent advances in conservation and population genomics data analysis, Evolutionary Applications), and another paper describing the MCMC approach is in preparation with Gordon Luikart and Thierry Gosselin.
